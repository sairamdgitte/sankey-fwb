Notes on Classification,,,,,
"The taxonomy, ""Lean Labor"", ""Lean Liberal"" and ""Middle of the road"" is taken from the 1995 paper ""Journalists Percepotion of Bias"" by John Hennington.  This paper used a survey of journalists to classify individual mastheads into the categories. We have mapped the Journalist's classifications of individual outlets onto this list of publishers. Using survey data from 1995, it's inevitable that some of the classifications are outdated. 

Many of these publishers no longer exist and have been absorbed by either News Corp or Fairfax, making them hard to classify. In these cases they have been given the classification that applied to their current parent company, however, this may not reflect the actual political leaning of historical articles. ",,,,,
